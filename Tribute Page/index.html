                <h3>Here's a time line of Igor Sikorsky life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>MAY 25, 1889 Igor Sikorsky was born in Kiev, Ukraine (at that time was part of the Russian
                        Empire)</li>
                    <li>1901 When he was 12 he made his first toy helicopter</li>
                    <li>1913 He built the first four-engine plane</li>
                    <li>1913 Immigrating to the United States</li>
                    <li>1923 Sikorsky founded the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation</li>
                    <li>1939 Sikorsky designed and flew the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300</li>
                    <li>OCT 26, 1972 He died of old age at the age of 83</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Igor Sikorsky did not support the revolution. For a short time he collaborated with the French
                    invaders, and in February 1918 he left Russia forever. In 1923, he founded Sikorsky Aero
                    Engineering (now Sikorsky Aircraft) in the United States. First, this company was engaged in the
                    design of aircraft and seaplanes, and then rebuilt to create helicopters. The development of
                    technical thought allowed Sikorsky to return to the realization of the idea, which he rejected in
                    1910 as impossible.</p>
                <p>The first successful helicopter Sikorsky (S-43 aka VS-300) was presented to the public in 1939. In
                    1942, the Sikorsky R-4 helicopters were put into service with US and British aircraft. Later, other
                    models of Sikorsky helicopters were added to the arsenal of the United States and its allies.</p>
                <p>In the postwar years, Sikorsky's helicopters set a number of aviation records: the S-61 model was
                    the first of the helicopters to make a transatlantic flight, and the S-65 - the first flight across
                    the Pacific Ocean. Igor Sikorsky worked in his company until 1954. Then he transferred the affairs
                    to his son and retired.</p>

            <p>"The idea of a vehicle that could lift itself vertically from the ground and hover motionless in the air
                was probably born at the same time that man first dreamed of flying". "It would be right to say that
                the helicopter's role in saving lives represents one of the most glorious pages in the history of human
                flight." <span class="name">Igor Ivanovitch Sikorsky</span></p>
